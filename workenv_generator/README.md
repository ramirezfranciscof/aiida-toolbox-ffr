# Work Environment Generation

Original script obtained from the [QuantumMobile website](https://quantum-mobile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/launch.html#docker-container).

It might be necessary to install extra packages for doing `pip install -e .[all]`:

```
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libkrb5-dev
```

This was under "Install AiiDA (core)" => "pip + venv" => "Installation extras" => "Kerberos on Ubuntu" (see [the docs](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/intro/install_system.html#system-wide-installation)).
